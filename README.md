# AppChallenge100

Master app lives at the repo root (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`).

## App folder rule
Each new app in the challenge must live inside `/apps/<AppName>/`.

- App #2 is implemented at: `/apps/Docbuilder/`
- Entry point: `/apps/Docbuilder/index.html`

Use the master app launcher to track and link to sub-apps.
